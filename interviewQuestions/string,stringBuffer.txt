Q - Difference Between String and StringBuffer

String - Once we creates a string object we can't perform any changes in the existing Object.
         if we are trying to perform any changes with those changes new object will be created.
         this non-changable nature is nothing but IMMUTABILITY of string object.

Example - String s = new String("Chaman");
          s.concat("Pratap");
          Sopen(s);


StringBuffer - Once we creates a StringBuffer object we can perform any changes in the existing
               object. this changable is nothing but MUTABILITY of the StringBuffer object.

Example - StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Chaman");
          s.append("Pratap");
          Sopen(sb);
