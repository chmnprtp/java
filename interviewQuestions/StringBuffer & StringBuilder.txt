Q - Difference Between StringBuffer and StringBuilder?

StringBuilder is exactly same as StringBuffer(including Methods and Constructors) except the
following differences.


        StringBuffer                               StringBuilder
1. Every method present in StringBuffer       1. No method present in StringBuilder is 
    is synchronized                               synchronized.
2. At a time only thread is allow to          2. At a time multiple threads are allow to
    operate on StringBuffer object.              operate on StringBuilder object and hence.
  Hence StringBuffer object is Thread safe      StringBuilder object is not thread safe.
3. It increases waiting time of threads and   3. Threads are not required to wait to operate
    hence relatively performance is low.        on StringBuilder object and hence relatively
                                                performance is high
4. Introduced in 1.0 version                  4. Introduced in 1.5 version.
