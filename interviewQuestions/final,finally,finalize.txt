Q- Difference Between final, finally, finalize()

FINAL - (1) Final is a MODIFIER applicable for classes, methods and variable.
            If  a class declared as final then we can't extend that class.
            i.e. We can't create child class for that class.
        (2) If a method declared as final then we can't override that method in the child class.
        (3) if a variable declared as final then it will become constant and we can't perform 
            re-assignment for that variable.

FINALLY - Finally is a BLOCK always associated with try catch to maintain cleanup code.
            try
            {
                //Risky Code
            }
            catch
            {
                // Handling Code
            }
            finally
            {
                // Cleanup Code
            }

FINALIZE() - finalize() is a METHOD which is always invoked by garbage collector just before 
            destroying an object to perform cleanup activity.


NOTE -
            Finally meant for cleanup activites related to try block where as,
            finalize() meant for cleanup activities related to object.
